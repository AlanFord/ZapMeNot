 - add files necessary for packaging.
 - QA both html and pdf formats for the documentation.
 - consider converting **kwargs to include formal arguments needed for parent classes.
 - consider changing all "crossing" methods of shield classes to return a common value; either a list of vector points or a list of lengths along the associated ray object.
 - standardize the signature of argument lists to set_buildup_factor_material and set_filler_material methods of the Model class.
 - when passing strings for a material name, make sure the code is case-insensitive
 - check for coverage (basic tests may not include filler material feature)
