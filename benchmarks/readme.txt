Index for the benchmark cases

These are benchmark cases (as opposed to test cases).
The results produced by ZapMeNot can be compared to
results from MCNP and/or MicroShield7.
MCNP cases are stored in the mcnp folder while 
MicroShield7 cases are stored in the microshield folder.

Additionally, the benchmarks are repeated in the folder "workbooks"
using the commands that support a headless server.  This permits
the benchmarks to be run manually on such a server.
