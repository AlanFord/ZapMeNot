This documentation is a listing of the ZapMeNot classes
that are useful to the shielding practitioner.  Each
class description includes the parameters necessary
to create an object of that class as well as the methods
(i.e. functions) that the class provides.

Note that some classes are based on other ZapMeNot classes.  The base
classes may be selected to show additional methods available
from the base class.  For example. the BoxSource class is
based on both the Source and shield.Box classes.  An instance
of the BoxSource class includes all of the methods available
from the Source
and shield.Box classes.
