# ZapMeNot
A Python library for simple point-kernel photon shielding analyses.

This is very-much a work in progress - not ready for prime-time.

Side note:  A good location for stuff on python unit testing is

A good discussion of unit testing and directory structure can be found at

TL;DR

A command like the following will run a unit test module from the parent directory:
```
python -m unittest tests.test_material
```

To run all of the unit tests
```
python -m unittest discover
```
